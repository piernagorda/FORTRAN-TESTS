# Introduction

Fortran is considered by most people as the first high-level programming language in history. John Backus started working on in 1954 and the first manual for it was made public in 1956 (it was targetting the IBM 704). 

Since the very first manual until the 1990 revision, the language was called FORTRAN (its original name), so I thought it would be a nice gesture to call the language by its original name. In fact, all the code will be written in what we could call "classic Fortran". Before getting started, it's important to know what this repository will cover: 

* FORTRAN I
* FORTRAN II
* FORTRAN IV 
* FORTRAN 66
* FORTRAN 77 

FORTRAN III is not in that list since the manual was never made public. It included some new features like inline assembly code, and those features were naturally included in FORTRAN IV.  

In the future, I will create another repository targetting modern Fortran (from Fortran 90 all the way up until Fortran 2018, the latest version). I would also love to dedicate some time to code High Performance Fortran since it can be one of the fastest languages availables. However, as I said, it will be a future project. For now, I will be focusing on the legacy versions.
