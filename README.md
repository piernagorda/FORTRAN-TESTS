# FORTRAN-TESTS

I've always wanted to learn classic FORTRAN (this is, FORTRAN I, II, III and IV) but due to some restrictions in modern compilers (some original instructions have been deleted from the language, some instructions were targetting physical elements not existing today, etc) it is not fully possible to replicate the same code in modern machines.
This is an attempt to learn classic FORTRAN with modern resources. I will upload old pieces of code adapted to modern compilers + pieces of my own code.
