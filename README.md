# Introduction
As a passionate of retro stuff, I always wanted to learn classic FORTRAN (this is, FORTRAN I, II, III and IV) but due to some restrictions in modern compilers (some original instructions have been deleted from the language, some instructions were targetting physical elements not existing today, etc) it is not fully possible to replicate the same code in modern machines.

This is an attempt to learn classic FORTRAN with modern resources. I will upload old pieces of code adapted to modern compilers + pieces of my own code. The resources used are the following:

- FORTRAN I: https://www.pingdom.com/blog/fortran/
- FORTRAN II: https://archive.computerhistory.org/resources/text/Fortran/102653989.05.01.acc.pdf
- FORTRAN III: not found yet
- FORTRAN IV:  not found yet

Another good source of information is the Wikipedia page, which contains some basic examples: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fortran
